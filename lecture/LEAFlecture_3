programming control structures
    for loop

input sensors and physical outputs
where to get sensors and things:
    adafruit
    sparkfun
    pololu

types of input sensors 
    switch
        button
        toggle
        slide
        lever
        any two pieces of metal connecting and disconnecting
    potentiometer
        rotary potentiometer
        slide potentiometer
        softpot (linear touch potentiometer)
    photoresistor
    IR reflectance sensor
    beam breaker
    bend sensor
    FSR (force sensing resistor)
    hall sensor (senses magnetic field)
    Accelerometer (acceleration in xyz)
    Gyroscope (orientation in xyz)
    IMU (integrated motion unit - combination of accelerometer and gyroscope)
    rotary encoder
        for turning by hand
        for counting revolutions of a shaft
    ultrasonic distance sensors (like PING)
    laser rangefinder

    these sensors may use different methods to communicate with the microcontroller:
        analog output (use an analog in on the Daisy)
        digital output (use a digital in on the Daisy)
        digital serial communication
            I2C
            SPI
    
physical outputs
    light:
        single LEDs
        LED strips (usually need a transistor to drive the current)
    motion (also usually need transistors to drive current or an extra driver board):
        motors:
            DC motor (spins with speed proportional to current)
            Hobby Servo Motor (goes to a position you tell it to go to, cheap and simple to control)
            Stepper Motor (also goes to a position, but more precise and can rotate 360 degrees)
        solenoids (for linear or rotary on/off motion - like car door locks)
